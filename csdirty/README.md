# A LaTeX Package for Quick and Dirty Typesetting (`csdirty.sty`)

The `csdirty.sty` package is designed to streamline LaTeX document preparation by compiling a set of commonly used packages. This package integrates functionalities for managing layout, spacing, mathematical tools, fonts, colour management, and algorithm formatting, amongst others. By incorporating these essential packages into a single module, `csdirty.sty` significantly simplifies the setup process for authors working in academic disciplines that demand high-quality typesetting and visual appeal.

## Package Overview

The `csdirty.sty` package consolidates a variety of essential LaTeX packages, enhancing the overall functionality of the document. It includes standard packages for typesetting, mathematics, algorithm formatting, colour management, figure handling, and more. Additionally, it provides customisable features such as toggling between full and short versions of documents, managing author comments, and handling appendices. The overall goal is to streamline document preparation for academic presentations and papers, particularly in computer science and related fields.

## Features

### Page Layout and Spacing

The package uses the `geometry` package to set the page dimensions to A4 format with 2.75 cm margins. The line spacing is adjusted to 1.5 using the `setspace` package. Furthermore, the `bxpdfver` package is utilised to specify the PDF version and enable compression for file size reduction.

### Mathematical Tools and Fonts

The `csdirty` package supports advanced mathematical typesetting with the `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `mathtools`, and `amsthm` packages. It enables bold and script-style fonts using the `bm` and `mathrsfs` packages, respectively, and enhances fraction typesetting with `nicefrac`. Additionally, the package incorporates the `siunitx` package for dealing with units and numerical data, and the `mathalpha` package for customising calligraphic and blackboard bold fonts.

### Colour Management

Through the `xcolor` package, the `csdirty` package supports a wide range of colours, including X11, SVG, and named colours. The accent colour can be customised, and a default is set using `csthm.sty` if available. The package also supports intelligent spacing after commands through the `xspace` package.

### Text and Font Enhancements

The package improves typographical features using the `microtype` package for better text justification and hyphenation. It also provides support for smart quotation marks (`csquotes`), underlining, and strikethroughs (`ulem`), and ensures consistent font rendering using `lmodern`. Text symbols such as degree signs are available through the `textcomp` package.

### Algorithm Formatting

The package incorporates `algorithm2e`, a powerful package for formatting algorithms. It allows for customisation of algorithm steps, captions, and line numbers, ensuring that algorithms are presented clearly and with the desired structure. The `listings` and `fancyvrb` packages also provide syntax highlighting for code.

### Hyperlinks and Cross-referencing

The `hyperref` package is integrated to manage hyperlinks, bookmarks, and citation links in the document. The package ensures that links are colour-coded for easier navigation, and it supports Unicode characters. The `cleveref` and `xr` packages simplify cross-referencing by automatically formatting references and enabling linking between multiple documents.

### Figures and Tables

The `csdirty.sty` package supports high-quality graphics and table management. It includes packages like `graphicx`, `pgfplots`, `tikz`, and `mdframed` for diagram creation and visual presentation. The `float`, `array`, `booktabs`, and `multirow` packages ensure professional formatting for figures and tables, while `subcaption` provides additional support for managing subfigures and subcaptions.

### Customisable Lists

The `enumitem` package is used to enhance the customisation of lists, allowing users to modify list types and bullet styles. The package provides a more flexible environment for configuring enumerated and itemised lists, improving the document’s overall presentation.

### Cryptography and Complexity Theory

The package includes support for cryptography and complexity theory symbols through the `tcscrypto` package, if it is available. This is particularly useful for technical documentation in computer science, cryptography, and related fields.

### Miscellaneous Enhancements

Other features include support for external PDF inclusion (`pdfpages`), placeholder text generation (`lipsum`), and URL line-breaking (`xurl`). Conditional logic can be applied using the `etoolbox` package, allowing for greater flexibility in document management.

### Appendix Handling

The `appendix` package is configured to manage appendices effectively, ensuring they are included in the table of contents and appropriately styled in the document. Each appendix begins on a new page, and the title is prefixed with “Appendix.”

## Usage

To use the `csdirty` package in a LaTeX document, include the following in the preamble:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{csdirty}

\title{My Research Paper}
\author{Author Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This is a brief summary of the document's content.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    This section introduces the topic.

\end{document}
```

This simple example demonstrates how to integrate the `csdirty` package into a document, making the process of document preparation efficient while maintaining a high level of typographical and functional sophistication.
