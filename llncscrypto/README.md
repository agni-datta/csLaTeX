# llncscrypto: Enhanced LaTeX Style Package for LNCS + Cryptography

> **llncscrypto** extends the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) document class with advanced features for cryptography and theoretical computer science papers.

## Overview

**llncscrypto** is a comprehensive LaTeX style package that enhances the LNCS document class with specialized tools for cryptography and theoretical computer science research. It provides enhanced theorem environments, TikZ graphics support, improved captions, and specialized tools for cryptographic notation and diagrams.

## Features

- **Enhanced Theorem Environments:** LLNCS-compliant styling with advanced theorem, lemma, definition, and proof environments
- **TikZ Graphics Support:** Comprehensive TikZ graphics library support for diagrams and figures
- **Improved Captions:** Enhanced caption formatting and positioning for figures and tables
- **Cryptography Macros:** Specialized macros and notation for cryptographic papers
- **Advanced Tables:** Professional table formatting with booktabs and array support
- **Smart Cross-Referencing:** Intelligent cross-referencing with cleveref integration
- **Appendix Management:** Tools for managing appendices and supplementary material
- **PDF Optimization:** Advanced PDF settings for optimal document presentation
