%% llncscrypto.sty — Comprehensive LaTeX Style for LNCS and Cryptography
%%
%% FORMAL PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION (v1.2.1, 2025/06/26)
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% DESCRIPTION:
%%   The llncscrypto package is an advanced LaTeX style extension for the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)
%%   document class, tailored for cryptography, theoretical computer science, and mathematical research writing.
%%   It provides modern typesetting, robust theorem and proof environments, cryptography-specific macros,
%%   advanced figure/table handling, and seamless integration with TikZ, cleveref, hyperref, and more.

%%
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% CAVEATS & NOTES:
%%   - Do not remove or modify package calls unless necessary; use settings.tex/commands.tex for customizations.
%%   - Theorems and environments are only enabled with theorems option.
%%   - TikZ libraries are loaded only with tikz option.
%%   - Crypto macros require tcscrypto.sty to be present.
%%   - Upright Greek letters are provided with robust fallbacks if upgreek is not available.
%%   - settings.tex and commands.tex are loaded automatically if present in the document directory.
%%   - Some features (e.g., fullpage, captions) may not be allowed for final submission to all conferences.
%%   - For best results, use with a modern TeX engine (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX).
%%   - Some hacks (e.g., claim counters, custom proof environments) may not be compatible with all packages.
%%   - If you need to add or override anything, do so in settings.tex or commands.tex, not in this file.
%%   - The package is robust to missing dependencies and will issue warnings if features are unavailable.
%%
