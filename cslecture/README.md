## Package Overview

The `cslecture` package is designed to streamline the creation of high-quality lecture materials in the field of computer science. It offers a wide array of functionalities to address the diverse needs of educators and researchers in conveying complex concepts effectively.

## Features

### Typography and Formatting

- Sets the document font to `cochineal` for improved readability and aesthetics.
- Utilizes `biolinum` as the sans-serif font and `anonymouspro` as the monospaced font for consistent and modern typography.
- Enhances mathematical typesetting using the `newtxmath` package, ensuring clear and legible equations.
- Adjusts line spacing to one and a half using the `setspace` package, striking a balance between readability and economy of space.
- Provides enhanced text justification using the `ragged2e` package, improving the appearance of text blocks.

### Theorem Environments

The `cslecture` package includes a comprehensive collection of coloured theorem environments, each with its own distinctive colour scheme for enhanced visual appeal and clarity. These environments cover a wide range of environments used in computer science, including:

- Theorems
- Lemmas
- Corollaries
- Propositions
- Claims
- Conjectures
- Definitions
- Examples
- Remarks
- Facts
- Notes
- Questions
- Cases
- Exercises
- Problems
- Properties
- Solutions
- Important points
- Keypoints
- Highlights

These environments are defined using the powerful `tcolorbox` package, allowing for customizable box styling to suit various presentation styles.

### Page Layout and Headers/Footers

- Sets the page layout to `A4 paper size` with `3cm` margins using the `geometry` package, optimizing space utilization and readability.
- Customizes headers and footers using the `fancyhdr` package, providing flexibility in formatting document headers and footers.

### Colours

- Utilizes various colour definitions from the `xcolor` package, offering a rich palette of colours to choose from for highlighting important content and visual elements.

### Lists

- Customizes lists using the `enumitem` package, eliminating item separation globally and providing control over list formatting.

### Tables and Matrices

- Enhances table formatting using packages like `booktabs`, `longtable`, `array`, `tabularx`, `multirow`, and `multicol`, ensuring professional and readable tables.

### Figures and Captions

- Improves figure formatting with packages such as `graphicx`, `caption`, `subcaption`, `float`, and `wrapfig`, allowing for the inclusion of high-quality graphics and captions.

### Verbatim and Listings

- Supports verbatim text and source code listings with the `verbatim` and `listings` packages, facilitating the inclusion of code snippets and other verbatim content.

### Algorithms

- Includes support for typesetting algorithms using the `algorithm2e` package, making it easy to present algorithmic solutions with clear formatting and syntax highlighting.

### Hyperlinks and Cross-references

- Enhances cross-referencing and hyperlinking using the `hyperref` package and intelligent cross-referencing with `cleveref`, enabling seamless navigation within the document and external references.

### Bibliography

- Manages citations and bibliography using the `natbib` package with the `ieeetr` bibliography style, ensuring consistency and compliance with academic standards.

### Miscellaneous

- Provides control over PDF version with the `bxpdfver` package, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with different PDF viewers.
- Supports line numbering, inclusion of external PDF pages, drawing with `TikZ`, and adding to-do notes with `todonotes`, facilitating document management and collaboration.

## Usage

1. Load the package in the preamble of your LaTeX document:

```latex
\usepackage{cslecture}
```

1. After loading the package, you can utilize its features throughout your document to create engaging and informative lecture materials.

## Example

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{cslecture}

\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}
This is an example document using the \texttt{cslecture} package.

\begin{theorem}{Pythagorean Theorem}{PeachPuff}{black}
    In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof follows directly from the definition of a right triangle and the Pythagorean theorem.
\end{proof}

\end{document}
```

This example demonstrates the usage of theorem environments provided by the `cslecture` package to create visually appealing and informative lecture materials.
