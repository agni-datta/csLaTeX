% cslecture: Comprehensive Settings for Computer Science Lectures

% Introduction:
%   - The cslecture package offers a wide range of functionalities and environments designed specifically for academic lectures and documents in the field of computer science.
%   - Include the package in the preamble using \usepackage{cslecture}.
%   - Utilize the provided environments and settings to enhance the structure and formatting of your documents.
%   - Refer to the detailed documentation below for specific commands and environments available.

% Requirements:
%   - This package requires various other packages to enable enhanced mathematical capabilities, typography, colors, and more.

% Customizations:
%   - Redefinitions, tweaks, and hacks are included to customize various aspects of the document formatting and layout, such as page numbering, headings, and spacing around equations.

% Convenience:
%   - Custom commands are defined for inline code, highlighting text, and adding inline notes, providing convenience for authors to format their content effectively.

% Consistency:
%   - Page numbering style and headers/footers are customized to ensure consistency and clarity throughout the document.

% Title Formatting:
%   - The \maketitle command is redefined to format the title, author, and date of the document in a colored box, enhancing the visual appeal of the title page.

% Structure:
%   - Heading commands such as \section and \subsection are redefined to customize their appearance and spacing, improving the readability and organization of the document structure.

% Styling:
%   - New theorem-like environments are defined using the tcolorbox package, providing colored boxes for theorems, lemmas, corollaries, definitions, examples, remarks, and more. Additionally, proof environments are defined for writing proofs with proper formatting.

% Enhancements:
%   - Additional features include support for algorithms, tables, figures, verbatim text, hyperlinks, cross-references, bibliography management, line numbering, drawing, and to-do notes.

% Usage Rights:
%   - The package is released under the [License Name]. Users are encouraged to review the license terms for permitted usage and redistribution.
