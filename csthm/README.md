# The `csthm` Package

## A Comprehensive Set of Theorem Environments for Computer Science

The `csthm` package provides a comprehensive collection of theorem-like environments specifically designed for use in computer science documentation. It features a range of customizable theorem styles, distinct visual markers for different types of content, integrated support for cross-referencing, and extensive customization options. This README provides detailed examples, usage guidelines, and an overview of all available environments and features in the package.

---

## Package Overview

The `csthm` package offers a robust and flexible solution for typesetting theorems, definitions, proofs, and related content typically found in computer science literature. The package provides a variety of specialized environments, each with distinct visual markers and formatting styles suited to different types of content.

### Key features include

- Distinct visual styles for different content types, including theorems, definitions, proofs, and more.
- Customizable theorem headers and QED symbols.
- Optional integration with the `cleveref` package for enhanced cross-referencing.
- Specialized environments tailored for theoretical computer science content.
- Support for both numbered and unnumbered variants of all environments.

---

## Installation

The `csthm` package can be installed via your TeX distributionâ€™s package manager or downloaded directly from CTAN:

- [https://ctan.org/pkg/csthm](https://ctan.org/pkg/csthm)

---

## Basic Usage

To use the package, simply include it in the preamble of your document:

```latex
\usepackage{csthm}
```

If you require integration with the `cleveref` package for enhanced cross-referencing, load the package as follows:

```latex
\usepackage[cleveref]{csthm}
```

---

## Environments

The `csthm` package provides a wide range of theorem-like environments. Each environment is associated with a distinct visual style, marked by a specific bullet symbol. The package supports both numbered and unnumbered versions of each environment, with the unnumbered variants achieved by appending an asterisk (`*`) to the environment name (e.g., `theorem*`).
