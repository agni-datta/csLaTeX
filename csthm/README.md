# Theorem Environments for Computer Science (`csthm.sty`)

## Overview

The `csthm` package provides customized theorem-like environments specifically designed for computer science documents. It offers a set of predefined theorem styles and environments to streamline the creation of theorems, definitions, remarks, and other common structures in computer science papers and documents.

## Features

- **Pre-defined theorem styles:** `thmstyle`, `defstyle`, `remarkstyle`, and `hltstyle`
- **Theorem environments:** theorem, fact, assumption, claim, conjecture, corollary, lemma, property, proposition
- **Definition environments:** definition, example, exercise, problem, question
- **Remark environments:** note, remark, solution
- **Highlight environments:** important, highlight, key-point
- **Custom environments:** case, axiom
- **Accent Colour:** Customizable accent colour
- **Cleveref Support:** Optional integration with `cleveref` package

## Installation

1. Download the `csthm.sty` file.
2. Place it in the same directory as your LaTeX document or in your local TeX tree.

## Usage

Load the package in your LaTeX document:

```latex
\usepackage{csthm}
```

To use the package with `cleveref` support:

```latex
\usepackage[cleveref]{csthm}
```

## Examples

```latex
\begin{theorem}
  This is a theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  This is a definition.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  This is a remark.
\end{remark}

\begin{case}
  \item This is case 1.
  \item This is case 2.
\end{case}

\begin{axiom}
  \item This is axiom A.
  \item This is axiom B.
\end{axiom}
```

## Customization

To change the accent colour:

```latex
\setaccentcolor{blue}
