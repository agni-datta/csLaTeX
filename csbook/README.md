# A Group of LaTeX Packages

## Overview (`csbook.sty`) for Typesetting Computer Science Books

The `csbook` package provides a comprehensive set of tools and environments for creating academic books and documents in the field of computer science. It aims to streamline the creation process while maintaining a professional and visually appealing output.

- Robust support for theorem, definition, and other specialized environments with coloured boxes
- Flexible handling of tables, figures, and subfigures with enhanced captions
- Extensive bibliography management with BibLaTeX, including back-references and citation styling
- Convenient commands for creating abstracts, appendices, dedications, and epigraphs
- Seamless integration with common LaTeX packages and libraries for additional functionality
- Support for various font styles and sizes, including monospace for code snippets
- Micro-typographic enhancements for improved typography and aesthetics
- Automatic indexing and glossary support for terms and acronyms
- Versatile drawing and diagram capabilities using TikZ and pgfplots

## Usage

1. Load the package in the preamble using `\RequirePackage{csbook}`.
2. Utilize the provided environments and commands to structure and format your document.

## Available Environments

The package defines a wide range of environments for various content types:

- Theorem-like environments: `theorem`, `lemma`, `corollary`, `proposition`, `claim`, `conjecture`
- Definition-like environments: `definition`, `example`, `remark`, `fact`, `note`, `question`
- Miscellaneous environments: `case`, `exercise`, `problem`, `property`, `solution`
- Emphasis environments: `important`, `keypoint`, `highlight`

Each environment can be customized with a specific background colour, title font colour, and content font style.

## Commands

The package provides several custom commands, including:

- `\code{…}`: Formats code snippets with a monospace font.
- `\newterm{…}`: Indexes a given label and expands the associated acronym.
- `\dedication{…}{…}`: Formats individual dedication entries.
- `\generateDedications{…}`: Generates the complete set of dedications.
- `\subtitle{…}`: Defines the subtitle of the document.

## Options

The package supports the following options:

- `normalthm`: Use the default LaTeX theorem environments.
- `fancythm`: Use the custom colored theorem environments.

## Dependencies

The `csbook` package requires a comprehensive set of LaTeX packages, including:

- Engine detection: `ifxetex`, `ifluatex`
- Advanced programming: `etoolbox`, `xpatch`, `xkeyval`, `kvoptions`
- Color support: `xcolor`
- PDF management: `bxpdfver`
- Language and typography: `babel`, `csquotes`, `microtype`
- Formatting and spacing: `indentfirst`, `needspace`
- Math support: `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, `amssymb`, `amsthm`, `unicode-math`
- Font selection: `biolinum`, `Fira Mono`, `mathalpha`, `nicefrac`
- Page layout: `geometry`, `fancyhdr`
- Sectioning customization: `titlesec`
- Table of contents: `tocloft`
- Todo notes: `todonotes`
- Index support: `imakeidx`
- Hyperlinks and cross-references: `hyperref`, `cleveref`, `url`
- List customization: `enumitem`
- Algorithms: `algorithm2e`
- Framed environments: `mdframed`, `tcolorbox`
- Text justification and footnotes: `ragged2e`, `footnote`, `footmisc`, `multicol`, `multirow`
- Tables, figures, and captions: `array`, `booktabs`, `longtable`, `float`, `graphicx`, `caption`, `subcaption`, `tabularx`, `wrapfig`
- Appendices: `appendix`
- Unformatted text and code: `verbatim`
- Drawings and diagrams: `tikz`, `pgfplots`
- Glossary and acronym support: `glossaries-extra`
- Bibliography management: `biblatex`

## Examples

Here’s an example of how to use the `csbook` package:

```latex
\documentclass{book}
\RequirePackage{csbook}

\title{Introduction to Computer Science}
\subtitle{A Comprehensive Guide}
\author{John Doe}

## Overview for `cscode.sty` for Typesetting Code Listings

The `cscode.sty` package is a powerful tool for incorporating code snippets and listings into your LaTeX documents. It provides a comprehensive set of features that make it easy to format and display code in a consistent and visually appealing manner.

## Key Features

1. **Predefined Styles for Popular Languages**: The package includes predefined styles for several popular programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and Rust. These styles ensure consistent syntax highlighting and formatting for your code listings.
2. **Customizable Environments**: The package defines a `codebox` environment that allows you to easily display code listings with a numbered caption and optional label. You can also use the shorthand `\addcode` command for a more concise way of adding code.
3. **Syntax Highlighting**: The package leverages the power of the `listings` package to provide syntax highlighting for your code. The predefined styles use a carefully chosen color palette to make the code more readable and visually appealing.
4. **Line Numbering**: Code listings are automatically numbered, making it easy to reference specific lines of code in your text.
5. **Cross-Reference Support**: The package integrates with the `cleveref` package to provide customized cross-reference formatting for your code listings.
6. **Compatibility with csbook Class**: The package checks for the presence of the `csbook` class and ensures compatibility, providing a warning if the class is not loaded.
7. **Extensibility**: You can easily create new custom styles or modify the existing ones to suit your specific needs. The package’s modular design makes it easy to extend and customize.

## Usage

To use the `cscode.sty` package in your LaTeX document, simply add the following line to your preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{cscode}
```

### Displaying Code Listings

You can use the `codebox` environment to display code listings. The environment takes an optional argument for the caption title, which defaults to “Code Box”:

```latex
\begin{codebox}[My Code Example]
  \lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{path/to/code.c}
\end{codebox}
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand `\addcode` command, which takes four arguments:

1. The caption title
2. A label for the code listing
3. The style to use (e.g., `CStyle`, `CPlusPlusStyle`, `JavaStyle`, `PythonStyle`, `RustStyle`)
4. The path to the code file

```latex
\addcode{My Code Example}{my-code-example}{CStyle}{path/to/code.c}
```

## Customization

The package provides a set of predefined styles for various programming languages, but you can also create your own custom styles or modify the existing ones to suit your specific needs. The package uses the `listings` package for code formatting, so you can refer to the `listings` package documentation for more information on customization options.

## Compatibility and Dependencies

The `cscode.sty` package is designed to be compatible with the `csbook` class. If the `csbook` package is not loaded, the package will issue a warning and proceed to load the necessary packages (`xcolor`, `mdframed`, `hyperref`, and `cleveref`).

## License

The `csbook` and`cscode` package is released under the MIT License.
