% This LaTeX package, `csmath`, provides a collection of custom commands tailored for computer scientists, aimed at simplifying the typesetting of mathematical notation commonly encountered in computer science and related fields.

% It is often cumbersome to consistently format mathematical notation in LaTeX documents, especially in fields such as computer science where certain symbols and notations are frequently used. This package aims to alleviate this burden by providing intuitive and easy-to-use commands for typesetting mathematical expressions and symbols commonly encountered in computer science literature and research.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Mathematical Notation

% To enhance readability and maintain consistency, the package includes commands for various mathematical notations commonly used in computer science:

% - \mathify{}: Ensures that the argument is typeset in math mode.
% - \set{}: Formats a set with curly braces, automatically sizing the braces.
% - \floor{}: Formats the floor function with proper brackets.
% - \abs{}: Formats the absolute value with vertical bars and automatic sizing.
% - \intersection: Formats the intersection symbol.
